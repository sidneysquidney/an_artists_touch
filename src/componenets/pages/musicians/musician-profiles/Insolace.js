  "Hailing from London, the Modern Alternative Rock band INSOLACE have achieved a lot in their brief history, including sold out shows in London and Brighton. Formed from the ashes of guitarist Conor Hyde’s previous band, Oceans, this 4 piece also features Millie Cook on vocals, Sam Bryant on bass and Onyi Olisa on drums. Lyrically the band are tackling the negative stigma of mental illness head on, and their sound perfectly mirrors the swinging highs and lows of depression and mania. They aim to offer hope and positive guidance to their listeners through their music.",
